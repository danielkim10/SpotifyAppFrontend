# Rules For Styling This Project

- Use PascalCase for file names.

- Use single-quotation for imports, double-quotation for all other strings.

- For JSX elements with many props, split it into one prop per line.

- Use the following order for import statements:

    - modules: hooks from react and other modules
    - interfaces: user-built interfaces
    - utilities: custom hooks and helper functions
    - components: user-built components
    - mui components: components from Material UI
    - mui icons: icons from Material UI
